## ~insom

Hey. Here's some things that I have made or contributed to. I've been an engineer at @slicelife 🍕, @internetarchive 📖, at @Shopify 🛒 and at @iwebsolutions 🕸️ (added together those make nearly twenty years of experience).

~I no longer use GitHub for work, so my contribution graph is fading away -- but I'm inclined to let it fade, thanks.~

*Updated*: I do actually use it for work now, but I'm still not likely to push new personal projects here.

I'm not boycotting GitHub, but it doesn't suit the way that I want to work on my own things. 🌱
